- Voice-based interaction with AI for dynamic brainstorming sessions
- Automatic transcription of voice recordings using OpenAI's Whisper API
- Comprehensive conversation history management
- High-quality audio playback of recorded sessions
- Cross-platform support 
  - Developed on Android
  - Windows work with react-native-windows and Electron but no release yet
  - iOS not addressed yet
- Data synchronization with OneDrive
- Integration with OneNote for structured knowledge base management
- Dark/Light theme support with system preference detection
- Automatic subject summarization for easy conversation categorization
- Individual message audio playback with Text-to-Speech fallback
