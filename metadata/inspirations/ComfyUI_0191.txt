Create a modern, scalable logo for a mobile app called "ThoughtForgeAI". The logo should be:

1. Concept: Blend the ideas of thought, AI, and forging/creation
2. Style: Minimalist and contemporary, with clean lines and simple shapes
3. Colors: Use a palette of cool blues and teals, with accents of warm orange or gold to represent AI and human thought respectively
4. Main element: A stylized brain or neuron network, subtly incorporating circuit-like patterns
5. Secondary element: A small anvil or hammer icon, suggesting the "forge" aspect
6. Typography: Include "ThoughtForgeAI" in a modern, sans-serif font, ensuring readability at small sizes
7. Layout: The icon should be able to stand alone for small displays, with text integrated for larger formats
8. Scalability: Design with vector graphics to ensure clarity at both small (16x16 pixels) and large sizes
9. Negative space: Utilize negative space creatively to add depth and complexity
10. Balance: Maintain visual balance between the icon elements and the text
11. Versatility: Ensure the logo works well on both light and dark backgrounds
12. Uniqueness: Avoid clich√©d AI imagery like robots or gears

Additional notes:
- The logo should convey intelligence, creativity, and technological innovation
- Consider subtle gradients for depth, but ensure they translate well to monochrome
- Test the logo at various sizes to ensure all elements remain clear and recognizable
- The overall impression should be sophisticated yet approachable

Please provide multiple variations of this concept, including versions with and without the text, and in both color and monochrome.
